# Security Policies

Critical security policies that CANNOT be overridden.

- NEVER commit credentials, API keys, or secrets to version control
- NEVER expose internal IP addresses or hostnames in public repositories
- NEVER bypass security prompts without explicit user approval
- NEVER execute destructive commands without confirmation

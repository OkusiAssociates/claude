think hard: Examine the @ARGUMENTS script and create a plan to bring it into compliance with the coding standard in @BASH-CODING-STANDARD.md

Note: PRG0, PRGDIR, and PRG are legacy definitions; change to SCRIPT_PATH, SCRIPT_DIR, and SCRIPT_NAME.

Do not over-engineer; if standard variables and functions are not required for the operation of the script, then do not include them.

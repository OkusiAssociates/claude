# Documentation Standards

## README Files
- Do **not** mention files that are listed in `.gitignore` when writing README.md files
- Keep documentation focused on files that are tracked in version control

## Documentation Icons

When writing documentation, use these standardized icons:

| Purpose | Icon |
|---------|------|
| Info    | ◉    |
| Debug   | ⦿    |
| Warning | ▲    |
| Success | ✓    |
| Error   | ✗    |

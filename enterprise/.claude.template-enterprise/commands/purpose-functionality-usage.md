# Examine Codebase

Perform a comprehensive analysis of the current codebase to determine its:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this project solve? Who is it for?
- **Functionality**: What are the key features and capabilities?
- **Usage**: How is it meant to be used? What are the common workflows?

## Analysis Steps:

1. **Project Overview**
   - Read README.md and documentation files
   - Check package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files
   - Review configuration files

2. **Architecture Analysis**
   - Identify main entry points
   - Map out directory structure and key components
   - Understand data flow and processing pipeline

3. **Functionality Discovery**
   - Examine core scripts and modules
   - Identify key functions and their purposes
   - Look for command-line interfaces or APIs

4. **Usage Patterns**
   - Find example scripts or usage documentation
   - Check for test files that demonstrate functionality
   - Look for build or deployment scripts

5. **Summary Report**
   - Provide a concise overview of the project's purpose
   - List main functionalities with brief descriptions
   - Include practical usage examples
   - Note any important dependencies or requirements
   - Save to file ./PURPOSE-FUNCTIONALITY-USAGE.md

Please provide a comprehensive but concise analysis suitable for someone new to the codebase.
